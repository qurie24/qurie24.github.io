        <!-- <h1>Getting there</h1>

        <h2>By train/bus:</h2>

        <p>
            For train travel, the main station is Warszawa Centralna (Warsaw Central),
            with connections to major European cities. Second biggest station,
            Warszawa Zachodnia (Warsaw West), is located closer to the
            facoulty, so if you have possibilty you should choose it over
            Warszawa Centralna
        </p>
        <p>
            Intercity buses arrive mostly at Warszawa Zachodnia (Warsaw West). 
            <i>FlixBus</i> and <i>Polskibus</i> provide extensive bus routes to Warsaw.
        </p>

        <p>Once you arrive at the train or bus station, we highly recommend taking public 
        transport (tram or bus). To get to know which one to choose use Google or Apple Maps. 
        We also recoment polish app <i>JakDojade</i>, which can naviagete you to your destiantion
        and it also allows you to buy ticket.</p>

        <h2>By plane:</h2>
        <p>There are two airports in Warsaw: Warsaw Chopin Airport, which is 
        located 40 min from the City Center, and Warsaw Modlin Airport, 
        which is located approx. 1.5h from the City Center. </p>

        <p>There is a direct bus from Warsaw Chopin Airport to the conference 
        place: bus number 178. You can buy the ticket in a bus (card only) or 
        in the app <i>JakDojade</i>.</p>

        <p>From Warsaw Modlin you can use public transport (bus + train) to get to
        Warszawa Centralna station, and then use bus or tram to get to the conference. </p>

        In both cases you can use taxi, which cost approx. ...  

        <h2>By car</h2>

        There is a paid parking 2 min away from the conference place. 

        <hr>

        <h1>Public transport</h1>

        <p>For traveling around the city we recommend you to use trams, buses, metro and local trains, which all have the same ticket system. There is a possibility of buying single fare ticekts as well as a 72h ticket, which is a perfect fit for our three-day conference. You can purchuse it in the ticket machines avaiable in every metro station and on some of the tram/bus stops. </p> -->
