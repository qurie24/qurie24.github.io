        <h1 id="transport">Getting there</h1>

        <h2 id="train">By train/bus:</h2>

        <p>
            For train travel, the main station is <strong>Warszawa Centralna</strong> (Warsaw Central),
            with connections to major European cities. Second biggest station,
            <strong>Warszawa Zachodnia</strong> (Warsaw West), is located closer to the
            conference place, so if you have possibilty you should choose it over
            Warszawa Centralna. You can check connections and book tickets on the
            <a href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank">PKP Intercity</a> website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intercity buses arrive mostly at <b>Warszawa Zachodnia</b> (Warsaw West).
            <a href="https://global.flixbus.com/" target="_blank">FlixBus</a>
            provide extensive bus routes to Warsaw.
        </p>

        <p>
            To get from the train/bus station to the conference place,
            check the <i>Public transport</i> section below.
        </p>

        <h2 id="plane">By plane:</h2>

        <p>There are two airports in Warsaw:</p>

        <li>

            <strong><a href="https://www.lotnisko-chopina.pl/en/index.html" target="_blank">Warsaw Chopin
                    Airport</a></strong>
            (Symbol: WAW),
            located within the city borders and
            very close to the University; handles most airlines
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="https://en.modlinairport.pl/" target="_blank">Warsaw Modlin Airport</a></strong>
            (Symbol: WMI), located 40 km
            north from Warsaw; handles economic airlines
        </li>

        <p>
            Poland is in the Schengen zone and observes the same border
            regulations as most other EU countries. It is
            enough to have a valid passport or a
            national ID (EU countries) to enter.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting to and from Warsaw Chopin Airport</h3>

        <p>
            Since the airport is located close to the city center,
            the trip usually takes less than <b>30 minutes</b>:
        </p>

        <li>
            Licensed taxis at the airports (Ele Taxi 8111111) –
            very fast and convenient, required to accept bank
            cards (no cash needed); the price is usually less
            than 40zł (9€),
        </li>
        <li>
            Bus 175 or 188 to <i>Banacha Szpital</i> stop -
            see the section on <i>Public transport</i> below,
        </li>
        <li>
            Uber/Bolt – also fast but requires meeting the driver outside the taxi zone.
        </li>

        <h3>Getting to and from Warsaw Modlin Airport</h3>

        <p>In this case, the trip could take up to <b>two hours</b>:</p>

        <li>
            <a href="https://www.modlin-taxi.pl/en/">Licensed taxis</a>
            – ask for a flat rate for getting to/from the airport
        </li>
        <li>
            Train connection by
            <a href="https://www.mazowieckie.com.pl/en">Koleje Mazowieckie</a>;
            use <i>Lotnisko Modlin</i> as the starting point because there
            is a shuttle linking the airport and the train station
            <i>Modlin</i>. The train goes to either <i>Warszawa Zachodnia</i>
            or <i>Warszawa Gdańska</i> stations and then one needs to get
            by a public transport or a taxi to the desired place.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.flixbus.pl/">Flixbus</a> or
            <a href="https://www.contbus.pl/ ">Contbus</a> buses,
            quite cheap and linking the airport directly with the Warsaw center:

        Polish currency is <i>Polish złoty</i> (<i>zł</i> in short)

        <b>
            99% of shops accept bank cards
        </b>
        (credit cards, debit cards from Visa, Mastercard,
        American Express, contactless payments) – there is usually no
        need to pay in cash. If you really need cash, use ATMs
        to withdraw some amount or use one of nearby exchange
        points (e.g. <a href="https://www.kantorcris.pl/" target="_blank">Kantor Cris 24/7</a>) to convert
