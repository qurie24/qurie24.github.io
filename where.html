        <h1>Getting there</h1>

        <h2>By train/bus:</h2>

        <p>
            For train travel, the main station is <b>Warszawa Centralna</b> (Warsaw Central),
            with connections to major European cities. Second biggest station,
            <b>Warszawa Zachodnia</b> (Warsaw West), is located closer to the
            conference place, so if you have possibilty you should choose it over
            Warszawa Centralna. You can check connections and book tickets on the
            <a href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank">PKP Intercity</a> website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intercity buses arrive mostly at <b>Warszawa Zachodnia</b> (Warsaw West).
            <a href="https://global.flixbus.com/" target="_blank">FlixBus</a>
            provide extensive bus routes to Warsaw.
        </p>

        <p>
            To get from the train/bus station to the conference place,
            check the <i>Public transport</i> section below.
        </p>

        <h2>By plane:</h2>

        <p>There are two airports in Warsaw:</p>

        <li>
            <a href="https://www.lotnisko-chopina.pl/en/index.html" target="_blank">
                <b>Warsaw Chopin Airport</b>
            </a>
            (Symbol: WAW),
            located within the city borders and
            very close to the University; handles most airlines
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://en.modlinairport.pl/" target="_blank">
                <b>Warsaw Modlin Airport</b>
            </a>
            (Symbol: WMI), located 40 km
            north from Warsaw; handles economic airlines
        </li>

        <p>
            Poland is in the Schengen zone and observes the same border
            regulations as most other EU countries. It is
            enough to have a valid passport or a
            national ID (EU countries) to enter.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting to and from Warsaw Chopin Airport</h3>

        <p>
            Since the airport is located close to the city center,
            the trip usually takes less than <b>30 minutes</b>:
        </p>

        <li>
            Licensed taxis at the airports (Ele Taxi 8111111) –
            very fast and convenient, required to accept bank
            cards (no cash needed); the price is usually less
            than 40zł (9€) – see the section on Taxis below,
        </li>
        <li>
            Bus 175 or 188 to “Szpital Banacha” stop -
            see the section on <i>Public transport</i> below,
        </li>
        <li>
            Uber/Bolt – also fast but requires meeting the driver outside the taxi zone.
        </li>

        <h3>Getting to and from Warsaw Modlin Airport</h3>

        <p>In this case, the trip could take up to <b>two hours</b>:</p>

        <li>
            <a href="https://www.modlin-taxi.pl/en/">Licensed taxis</a>
            – ask for a flat rate for getting to/from the airport
        </li>
        <li>
            Train connection by
            <a href="https://www.mazowieckie.com.pl/en">Koleje Mazowieckie</a>;
            use „Lotnisko Modlin” as the starting point because there
            is a shuttle linking the airport and the train station
            “Modlin”. The train goes to either “Warszawa Zachodnia”
            or “Warszawa Gdańska” stations and then one needs to get
            by a public transport or a taxi to the desired place.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.flixbus.pl/">Flixbus</a> or
            <a href="https://www.contbus.pl/ ">Contbus</a> buses,
            quite cheap and linking the airport directly with the Warsaw center:

        <h1>Public transport</h1>

        <p>
            The network of buses, trams, trains, and metro (subway)
            is quite dense, and it is very convenient for reaching
            all parts of the city. Usually, it takes 20-40 minutes
            to reach outer districts from the center and. Trams,
            trains and metro are the fastest during the rush hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Google Maps</b> allows one to quickly find the best route. Just ask the app for directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another useful app is
            <b><a href="https://jakdojade.pl/warszawa/trasa/" target="_blank">JakDojade</a></b>
            which allows to find the best route and to this end
            uses LIVE bus/tram/metro GPS positions. English version is
            available in the mobile app only.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adult standard 75-minute ticket costs 4.40zł
            (approximately 1€). There are also 72-hour tickets and
            cheaper 20-minute tickets, for 36zł and 2.20zł,
            respectively. All tickets can be purchased in the vending
            machines across the city, in some shops and kiosks
            (e.g. Żabka, Ruch) or inside any vehicle.
            <b>Please note that the vending machines inside buses and
                trams do not accept cash, only bank cards.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            One can freely change buses/trams/metro until the validity
            of the ticket is used up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whole city of Warsaw is a single
            tariff Zone 1. Only suburbs are in Zone 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Do not forget to validate your ticket immediately after getting in the bus.</b>
            Unless the ticket is purchased with the vending machine in
            the bus or tram, one should validate it in one of yellow
            validators. One should clearly see the validity date/time
            printed on it. Check the website of the
            <a href="https://www.wtp.waw.pl/en/" target="_blank">Warsaw Public Transport</a>
            with more information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extensive network of <b>Uber</b> and <b>Bolt</b> is available
            in Warsaw for quite affordable price.

        <h1>Payments</h1>
        Polish currency is <i>Polish złoty</i> (<i>zł</i> in short)
        and most shops <b>do not</b> accept Euro. However,
        <b>
            99% of shops accept bank cards
        </b>
        (credit cards, debit cards from Visa, Mastercard,
        American Express, contactless payments) – there is usually no
        need to pay in cash. If you really need cash, use ATMs
        to withdraw some amount or use one of nearby exchange
        points (e.g. <a href="https://www.kantorcris.pl/" target="_blank">Kantor Cris 24/7</a>) to convert
        cash between PLN/EUR/USD etc.
        <hr>

        <h1>Other hints</h1>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.skycash.com/" target="_blank"><b>SkyCash</b></a>
            – very convenient app
            for purchasing public transport/train tickets as
            well as calling taxis (iTaxi corporation). Just attach
            your credit card and go. Public transport tickets
            purchased in the app need to be validated after entering
            a bus/tram by scanning a QR code displayed inside the
            vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Electric scooters</b> are provided by many companies,
            e.g. Bolt, Lime. Use their apps – they can be downloaded
            by scanning a QR code at the scooter’s handlebar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Public bicycles
            (<a href="https://veturilo.waw.pl/en/" target="_blank"><b>Veturilo</b></a>)
            are very convenient and thanks to a dense network
            of bike roads, they are great for moving around.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Żabka</b> and <b>Carrefour Express</b> stores are located everywhere,
            and they are open daily from 6am to 10pm (Carrefour) or
            11pm (Żabka). They offer food (also snacks, hot dogs,
            coffee to go), soft drinks, alcohol, basic
            cosmetics, pain killers etc., whatever one needs.
