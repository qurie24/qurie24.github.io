        <p class="abstract">
            Heralded imaging systems based on parametric down-conversion use one beam to illuminate the object which is
            detected by a single-pixel detector. An image is recovered from the signal beam with a spatially resolved
            detector, which never interacted with the object. In this study, we report a camera based on a heralding
            imaging system where the correlated photons were at non-degenerate wavelength. Infrared photons of signal at
            1550 nm wavelength illuminate the object and detected by InGaAs single photon detector. We record the image
            data from the coincidently detected photon at wavelength 810 nm using an electron multiplying charged
            coupled device (EMCCD) camera. By applying the photon counting technique to our image reconstruction, we
            obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio from correlated photons than direct imaging.

            Existing optical fiber for entanglement distribution will play a key role in distributed computing and
            quantum networks. Hence, it is necessary to study the adverse effects of imperfection in optical fiber on
            Entanglement distribution. In this work, we numerically analyze the impact of spatial fluctuations in the
            refractive index in optical fiber on maximally entangled polarization qubits. We consider both the case of
            Markovian and non-Markovian entanglement decay behavior numerically using the spin-boson model. To mitigate
            the effect of the Markovian and non-Markovian on entanglement decay, we propose Dynamical decoupling in
            optical fiber implemented using spaced half waveplates.

        <p class="abstract">
            We provide a detailed analysis of the character and strength of many-body Bell
            correlations in interacting multi-qubit systems with particle exchange
            symmetry. Such a configuration can be described by an effective Schrödinger-
            like equation, which allows precise analytical predictions. We show that in the
            vicinity of the quantum critical point, these correlations quickly become so
            strong that only a fraction of the qubits remain uncorrelated. We also identify
            the threshold temperature above which thermal fluctuations destroy Bell

        <p class="abstract">
            Long relaxation and dephasing times for qubits are crucial for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers.
            In our efforts to prolong the lifetimes of quantum superpositions, one must either run error correction
            codes or designs qubits with inherent noise protection. Targeting the specific parameter regime is crucial
            for achieving precise control and characterization of qubits. With the presence of Josephson harmonics in
            Al-AlOx-Al junctions detected and its effect on transmon artificial atoms already explored, in this
            presentation we examine how the presence of these higher-harmonics affects the various qubit designs like
            the 0-Pi qubit, cos2phi, and fluxonium qubit. We study how the presence a of few percent higher

            Jan Krzyżanowski (University of Warsaw)</p>

        <p class="abstract">
            Two-photon interference is essential for many quantum communication and sensing devices. This phenomenon is
            quite hard to observe, because it requires the indistinguishability of the interfering photons. The photons
            from various quantum devices may have mismatched spectrotemporal profiles, disturbing the two-photon
            interference. An interface is needed to obtain the indistinguishability of the photons and enable quantum
            information exchange between the mismatched devices. In this work we present a proof-of-concept experiment
            in which we perform a two-photon interference of photons with mismatched spectral bandwidths. We correct the
            spectrum of one photon to match it to the other one by applying a spectral compression to one of the photons
            using an electro-optic time lens. We can get about 60% interference visibility by using the time lens
            starting from almost no visibility.

            Marco Robbio (Université libre de Bruxelles)</p>

        <p class="abstract">
            The quantum central limit theorem derived by Cushen and Hudson provides the foundations for understanding
            how subsystems of large bosonic systems evolving unitarily do reach equilibrium. It finds important
            applications in the context of quantum interferometry, for example, with photons. A practical feature of
            current photonic experiments, however, is that photons carry their own internal degrees of freedom
            pertaining to, e.g., the polarization or spatiotemporal mode they occupy, which makes them partially
            distinguishable. The ensuing deviation from ideal indistinguishability is well known to have observable
            consequences, for example in relation with boson bunching, but an understanding of its role in bosonic
            equilibration phenomena is still missing. Here, we generalize the Cushen-Hudson quantum central limit
            theorem to encompass scenarios with partial distinguishability, implying an asymptotic convergence of the
            subsystem's reduced state towards a multimode Gaussian state defined over the internal degrees of freedom.
            While these asymptotic internal states may not be directly accessible, we show that particle number
            distributions carry important signatures of distinguishability, which may be used to diagnose experimental
            imperfections in large boson sampling experiments.

            Self-testing of quantum devices based on observed measurement statistics is a method to certify quantum
            systems using minimal resources. In Ref. [PRA 101, 032106 (2020)], a scheme based on observing measurement
            statistics that demonstrate Kochen-Specker contextuality has been shown to certify two-qubit entangled
            states and measurements without the requirement of spatial separation between the subsystems. However, this
            scheme assumes a set of compatibility conditions on the measurements which are crucial to demonstrating
            Kochen-Specker contextuality. In this work, we propose a self-testing protocol to certify the multi-qubit
            states and measurements without the assumption of the compatibility conditions, and at the same time without
            requiring the spatial separation between the subsystems. Our protocol is based on the observation of
            sequential correlations leading to the maximal violation of a temporal inequality derived from
            non-contextuality inequality. Moreover, our protocol is robust to small experimental errors or noise.

        <p class="abstract">
            Entanglement is a unique and invaluable resource for quantum information processing because it highlights
            the non-locality property, and enables various applications like distributed quantum computing, quantum
            teleportation and quantum key distribution (QKD). While various methods exist for harnessing it, time-bin
            entanglement is promising for long distance distribution over fiber due to its robustness against
            polarization mode distortion effects. However, its most common implementation suffers from a from a
            post-selection loophole (PSL) which invalidates the local-realism tests and prevents its use for device
            independent protocols. Here we present an experimental scheme to close the PSL by using fast and stable
            optical switches to deterministically route the photons in the state analyzers and avoid postselection. The
            implemented scheme working with 1550nm biphotons allows for distribution of “genuine” time-bin entanglement
            over existing telecom networks and we show a CHSH violation of S=2.56.

            Quantum algorithms that are able to break cryptographic schemes are relying on solving some group problems,

            gives us a way to realize different types of quantum resistant communication: from digital signatures,

            to diversify algorithmic problems we use for communication that is secure against quantum attacks. In this

            processes having different execution times or load values, leading to idle or wait times at synchronization
            points, where faster processes must wait for the slowest process to catch up. To mitigate this issue,
            applications can employ load balancing (LB) strategies, which migrate load between processes to even out
            load. This is often referred to as the Load Rebalancing Problem (LRP). While many approaches to solving the
            LRP exist, they can only be heuristics and hence further optimization potential exists. In our work, we turn
            to a novel approach by using hybrid classical-quantum approaches and present two versions of the constrained
            quadratic model for solving the LRP; the two differ in how they balance the number of qubits required with
            the types of applied constraints. We compare the quantum-based methods with classical methods using
            heuristic algorithms. We evaluate our approaches using imbalance ratio and speedup as metrics, as well as
            the number of migrated tasks to indicate overhead caused by migrations. Our results show that the
            quantum-based methods outperform the classic methods. For example, we need only 1/4 of the number of
            migrated tasks in a realistic use case compared with classical methods to balance the load.

            High-entropy materials (HEMs), which consist of multi-principal elements and a wide range of molar
            ratios of constituent elements, have emerged as a promising group of materials to tackle pressing
            energy and environmental challenges. These challenges encompass issues such as climate change and
            semiconductor chip shortages. This family of materials includes various variants, such as
            high-entropy catalysts, high-entropy oxides, high-entropy semiconductors, high-entropy
            superconductors, high-entropy ceramics, and more. A common challenge shared by these frontiers is
            the selection of elements and their molar ratios from the vast compositional space. In this
            presentation, I will provide examples of how emerging quantum computers, including quantum
            simulators and quantum hardware, can address this elemental design problem and contribute to the
            discovery of novel HEMs. I will also demonstrate how quantum machine learning algorithms exhibit the
            potential to accelerate the training process. Finally, I will outline several potential directions
            for HEM research that can benefit from the power of quantum computing.
