        <p class="abstract">
            Understanding and characterising quantum many-body dynamics remains a significant challenge due to both the
            exponential complexity required to represent quantum many-body Hamiltonians, and the need to accurately
            track states in time under the action of such Hamiltonians. This inherent complexity limits our ability to
            characterise quantum many-body systems, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to unlock their full
            potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to solve the Hamiltonian Learning (HL)
            problem-inferring quantum dynamics from many-body state trajectories-using Neural Differential Equations
            combined with an Ansatz Hamiltonian. Our method is reliably convergent, experimentally friendly, and
            interpretable, making it a stable solution for HL on a set of Hamiltonians previously unlearnable in the
            literature. In addition to this, we propose a new quantitative benchmark based on power laws, which can
            objectively compare the reliability and generalisation capabilities of any two HL algorithms. Finally, we
            benchmark our method against state-of-the-art HL algorithms with a 1D spin-1/2 chain proof of concept.

        </p>

        <p class="abstract">
            The superposition of causal order shows promise in various quantum technologies. However, the fragility
            of
            quantum systems arising from environmental interactions, leading to dissipative behavior and
            irreversibility, demands a deeper understanding of the possible instabilities in the coherent control of
            causal orders. In this work, we employ a collisional model to investigate the impact of an open control
            system on the generation of interference between two causal orders. We present the environmental
            instabilities for the switch of two arbitrary quantum operations and examine the influence of
            environmental
            temperature on each potential outcome of control post-selection. Additionally, we explore how
            environmental
            instabilities affect protocol performance, including switching between mutually unbiased measurement
            observables and refrigeration powered by causal order superposition, providing insights into broader
            implications.

        </p>

        <p class="abstract">
            The progress in cooling and control of ultracold quantum gases and their mixtures has allowed for
            engineering new states of matter in laboratories. For example, such system could be an ultradilute
            quantum
            liquid in a binary mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates, where a low compressibility favours constant
            bulk
            density and allows for formation of finite-size quantum droplets. We study one-dimensional ultradilute
            quantum liquids in the context of their collective excitations and Josephson dynamics. For instance, the
            breathing mode is the only excitation that remains trapped in a one-dimensional quantum droplet and its
            frequency is uniquely determined by the particle number. The Josephson oscillations are characterized by
            dynamics that differs from that of a single-component Bose-Einstein condensate and is characterized by
            non-linear localization revivals.

        <p class="abstract">
            We have developed a precise method of certification of the Hilbert space of single and bipartite quantum
            states. We constructed a witness, a special determinant function of probabilities of results of a
            specified
            measurement protocol, which is zero up to finite statistics error if the system is of a limited
            dimension.
            The proposed protocol involves prepare and measure scenario in the case of single systems, in which the
            two
            stages are independent or measure and measure scenario for a bipartite system, assuming the independence
            of
            the two parties. The application to IBM Quantum network revealed inconsistencies in the simple qubit
            picture of a qubit network, indicating a contribution of extra space beyond standard technical
            imperfections. The method demonstrates the usefulness of null witnessing in the diagnostics of quantum
            computers. We also show that even simple tests of no-signaling, which also count as null witnesses, fail
            in
            particular cases of IBM Quantum.

                loophole-free nonlocality</b> <br>
            Anubhav Chaturvedi (Gdańsk University of Technology)
        </p>

        <p class="abstract">
            The degree of experimentally attainable nonlocality, as gauged by the amount of loophole-free violation
            of
            Bell inequalities, remains severely limited due to inefficient detectors. We address an experimentally
            motivated question: Which quantum strategies attain the maximal loophole-free nonlocality in the
            presence of
            inefficient detectors? For any Bell inequality and any specification of detection efficiencies, the
            optimal
            strategies are those that maximally violate a tilted version of the Bell inequality in ideal conditions.
            In
            the simplest scenario, we demonstrate that the quantum strategies that maximally
            violate the tilted versions of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality are unique up to local isometries.
            However, self-testing via the standard sum of squares decomposition method turns out to be analytically
            intractable since even high levels of the Navascués-Pironio-Acín hierarchy are insufficient to saturate
            the maximum quantum violation of these inequalities. Instead, we utilize a novel Jordan's lemma-based
            proof
            technique to obtain robust analytical self-testing statements for the entire family of tilted-Bell
            inequalities. These results allow us to unveil intriguing aspects of the effect of inefficient
            detectors and the complexity of characterizing the set of quantum correlations, in the simplest Bell
            scenario.

            Many-body quantum systems can be characterised using the notions of <i>k</i>-separability and
            entanglement
            depth. A quantum state is <i>k</i>-separable if it can be expressed as a mixture of <i>k</i> entangled
            subsystems, and its entanglement depth is given by the size of the largest entangled subsystem. In this
            paper we propose a multipartite entanglement measure that satisfies the following criteria: (i) it can
            be
            used with both pure and mixed states; (ii) it is encoded in a single element of the density matrix, so
            it
            does not require knowledge of the full spectrum of the density matrix; (iii) it can be applied to large
            systems; and (iv) it can be experimentally verified. The proposed method allows the certification of
            <i>non-k</i>-separability of a given quantum state. We show that the proposed method successfully
            classifies
            three-qubit systems into known stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) classes,
            namely bipartite, W-, and GHZ-type entanglement. Furthermore, we characterise the
            <i>non-k</i>-separability in known nine SLOCC classes of four-qubit states, absolutely maximally

            states for five and six qubits and for arbitrary size qubit Dicke states.

                and uplink satellite scenario</b> <br>
            Kaushik Joarder (Nicolaus Copernicus University, Toruń)

        <p class="abstract">
            We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) in a
            satellite uplink channel during a noisy daylight background. This configuration is challenging due to
            the
            low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hence, to ensure secure QKD, it is essential to enhance the SNR by
            filtering out noise, which makes SPDC-based entangled-photon sources less attractive due to their lower
            brightness and broader spectral width. To address this, we first demonstrate an SPDC-based ultra-bright
            source (~8 Mcps/mW) of polarization-entangled photon pairs characterized by a narrow temporal jitter and
            spectral bandwidth of 0.35 ns and 0.54 nm FWHM respectively. Using this source, we measure the secret
            key
            rate and QBER for a hybrid QKD channel, with Alice connected via free space and Bob connected via a
            fiber
            channel. Our simulated uplink channel attenuation is varied by attenuating the signal photon counts
            (from 20
            dB to 50 dB). The background noise level at the satellite is simulated using a light source emitting
            unpolarized photons at a rate of up to a few MHz, with the same central wavelength as the signal
            photons. we
            also propose a novel theoretical model of polarization visibility that aligns well with our experimental
            data and is consistent with prevailing models in the field. Unlike other methods, this model is suitable
            for
            both continuous wave (CW) and pulse-pumped sources, providing a more intuitive and comparative
            understanding
            of both processes. Our model considers the density matrix of a non-ideal entangled photon source instead
            of
            an idealized Hamiltonian, as conventionally considered. Using this model, we demonstrate that
            entanglement-based QKD in uplink-daylight conditions is feasible only up to 400 km in a lower LEO orbit,
            using single-mode fiber (SMF) coupling and state-of-the-art technology.

        <p class="abstract">
            We present a novel mapping for studying 2D many-body quantum systems by solving an effective,
            one-dimensional long-range model in place of the original two-dimensional short-range one. In
            particular, we
            address the problem of choosing an efficient mapping from the 2D lattice to a 1D chain that optimally
            preserves the locality of interactions within the TN structure. By using Matrix Product States (MPS) and
            Tree Tensor Network (TTN) algorithms, we compute the ground state of the 2D quantum Ising model in
            transverse field with lattice size up to 64x64, comparing the results obtained from different mappings
            based
            on two space-filling curves, the snake curve and the Hilbert curve. We show that the locality-preserving
            properties of the Hilbert curve leads to a clear improvement of numerical precision, especially for
            large
            sizes, and turns out to provide the best performances for the simulation of 2D lattice systems via 1D TN

        <p class="abstract">
            We take into account the most relevant effects that can cause noise in the signal in a quantum optical
            coherence tomography (QOCT) setup, such as optical losses occurring in the QOCT interferometer and the
            quantum detection efficiency of the single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. Optical loss is a term
            that
            comprises a very wide spectrum of physical processes, including reflection, scattering on defects of the
            coating and absorption of light. As for the SPAD detector, the statistic of photons detected may differ
            from
            the initial state due to 1- non-perfect photon detection efficiency (loss), 2- false detections caused
            by
            thermal excitations (dark counts), and 3- by secondary photons detected by a neighboring element

            the coupling between these degrees of freedom leads to reduced-quality signals in the practical
            applications

            placed

            reference
            arm, while the other passes through the object. The sample in the object arm might alter the propagation
            time and OAM of the photon traveling along that arm. Thus, we investigate the spectral and OAM

            states without relying on conventional symmetries. Our model utilizes next-neighbor couplings and unit

                protocol</b> <br>
            Morteza Moradi (University of Warsaw)</p>

        <p class="abstract">
            Recently, there has been a growing focus on quantum communication due to its inherent security
            advantages.
            However, several key challenges remain, including the distribution of entangled states over long
            distances,
            closing Bell test loopholes, and enhancing the secure key rate. In this work, we propose an innovative
            device-independent QKD protocol based on the transmission of near-maximally entangled multiphoton states
            over long distances. The protocol leverages available resources such as two mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV)
            states and photon-number-resolving detectors.

            We also implement two numerical methods—min entropy and relative entropy—into the protocol. These
            methods
            are integrated with the NPA hierarchy to lower bound the eavesdropper's conditional entropy and optimize
            the
            secure key rate. Additionally, we employ two pre-processing techniques—noisy pre-processing and
            post-selection—to further optimize the final secure key rate.

        <p class="abstract">
            The quantum central limit theorem derived by Cushen and Hudson provides the foundations for
            understanding
            how subsystems of large bosonic systems evolving unitarily do reach equilibrium. It finds important
            applications in the context of quantum interferometry, for example, with photons. A practical feature of
            current photonic experiments, however, is that photons carry their own internal degrees of freedom
            pertaining to, e.g., the polarization or spatiotemporal mode they occupy, which makes them partially
            distinguishable. The ensuing deviation from ideal indistinguishability is well known to have observable
            consequences, for example in relation with boson bunching, but an understanding of its role in bosonic
            equilibration phenomena is still missing. Here, we generalize the Cushen-Hudson quantum central limit
            theorem to encompass scenarios with partial distinguishability, implying an asymptotic convergence of
            the
            subsystem's reduced state towards a multimode Gaussian state defined over the internal degrees of
            freedom.
            While these asymptotic internal states may not be directly accessible, we show that particle number
            distributions carry important signatures of distinguishability, which may be used to diagnose
            experimental
            imperfections in large boson sampling experiments.

        <p class="abstract">
            Self-testing of quantum devices based on observed measurement statistics is a method to certify quantum
            systems using minimal resources. In Ref. [PRA 101, 032106 (2020)], a scheme based on observing
            measurement statistics that demonstrate Kochen-Specker contextuality has been shown to certify two-qubit
            entangled states and measurements without the requirement of spatial separation between the subsystems.
            However, this scheme assumes a set of compatibility conditions on the measurements which are crucial to

            In quantum communication and information, single photon detectors with the photon-number-resolving (PNR)
            functionality are key to many protocols, such as quantum key distribution, the implementation of quantum
            repeaters using heralded single-photon sources and the realization of a photonic quantum computer.
            Superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) arrays are one of the most promising platforms
            for
            realizing such detectors with high photon number resolution efficiency while maintaining a high

            rate. Here, we develop an SNSPD array consisting of 28 pixels in a parallel architecture (P-SNSPD),
            requiring only one coaxial cable output for the whole array. The 28-pixel P-SNSPD presented here can
            reach
            ~90% system detection efficiency (SDE) at the single photon, 75% at the 2-photon, and 60% at the
            3-photon

            real-case
            applications. These detectors can also count at a high rate achieving a maximum count rate of 250 Mcps.
            Using only 4 of them, we could achieve a count rate of 1 Gcps at 45% of absolute efficiency. In
            addition,
            these detector have the unique ability to maintain &lt;60 ps timing jitter at 100 Mcps, making them
            extremely suitable to achieve high secret key rate for QKD.

        <p class="abstract">
            The clock frequency of electronic circuits has been stagnant at a few gigahertz for almost two decades
            because of the breakdown of Dennard scaling, which suggests that by miniaturizing transistors, they can
            run
            faster while consuming the same power. Optical-based computing offers a potential solution to this
            challenge. However, the lack of materials with sufficiently strong nonlinear interactions necessary for
            achieving all-optical switches led to large device sizes and high optical energy requirements that
            hindered
            scalable architectures. Recently, microcavities utilizing polymers as photoactive material in the regime
            of
            strong light-matter interaction have enabled the development of all-optical transistors capable of
            operating at room temperature with switching times below one picosecond. Nonetheless, the realization of
            complex circuits was restricted due to limitations posed by non-integrated vertical cavity geometry.
            Here,
            by leveraging silicon-on-insulator technology, we realize fully integrated metamaterial-based high-index
            contrast grating (HCG) microcavities filled with an organic polymer (MeLPPP) as photoactive material.
            This
            platform, capable of hosting a strong-light matter interaction regime system, shows integrated on-chip
            exciton-polariton condensation at ambient conditions. Furthermore, by exploiting the outcoupling
            resonance
            from one (control) cavity as input for the next (transistor) cavity, through seeded polariton
            condensation,
            we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical transistor action with switching time in the order of 1ps. Finally,
            the coupling of two resonators proves the cascadability of this technology which paves the way for the
            implementation of more complex logic circuits.

            The presentation considers the operation of addition as a bitwise arithmetic operation in the quantum

            Peres
            gates are considered. The optimization method of the implementation of the quantum full adder, given by
            Feynman, using the IBM Composer simulator is shown. For the sequential model of computation, the methods
            of
            building the adders of higher orders based on half-adders and full adders are shown. Addition is the
            most
            challenging operation to implement efficiently because of the need for carries. For the parallel model
            of
            calculations, the method of multi-bit addition with "carry lookahead method" (CLA) is demonstrated,
            which
            has a logarithmic complexity in terms of the number of steps performed by one parallel processor. The
            addition method with "carry signs prediction" based on Toffoli gates is considered. For the quantum
            computing model, the Toffoli gate is briefly considered as one of the methods of transferring the
            methods of
            implementing the addition operation from classical computational models (sequential and parallel) to the
            quantum computational model. The method of multi-bit addition based on a constant number of qubits is
            considered from a theoretical point of view. Using the example of adding two- and three-bit numbers, the
            implementation of the addition operation based on the quantum Fourier transform using the IBM composer
            simulator is shown. A program of adding two N-bit numbers based on the quantum Fourier transform is
            provided, using the Qiskit library to build a quantum circuit on 2N qubits and on N qubits. The quantum
            circuit includes few optimization steps.

            time-bin

            Load imbalance is a challenge for parallel applications in High Performance Computing (HPC). It is
            caused by
            processes having different execution times or load values, leading to idle or wait times at
            synchronization
            points, where faster processes must wait for the slowest process to catch up. To mitigate this issue,
            applications can employ load balancing (LB) strategies, which migrate load between processes to even out
            load. This is often referred to as the Load Rebalancing Problem (LRP). While many approaches to solving
            the
            LRP exist, they can only be heuristics and hence further optimization potential exists. In our work, we
            turn
            to a novel approach by using hybrid classical-quantum approaches and present two versions of the
            constrained
            quadratic model for solving the LRP; the two differ in how they balance the number of qubits required
            with
            the types of applied constraints. We compare the quantum-based methods with classical methods using
            heuristic algorithms. We evaluate our approaches using imbalance ratio and speedup as metrics, as well
            as
            the number of migrated tasks to indicate overhead caused by migrations. Our results show that the
            quantum-based methods outperform the classic methods. For example, we need only 1/4 of the number of
            migrated tasks in a realistic use case compared with classical methods to balance the load.
